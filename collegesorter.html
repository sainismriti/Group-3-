        Below you'll see a table with  information about every 4-year undergraduate college in the United States. Use the <b>"Column Visibility"</b> button to select whichever metric you're interested in comparing across schools.

      </p>
      <p>
        Please note: 
        <li><b>Admissions Rate</b> and <b>Graduation Rate</b> and <b>Economic Connectedness </b>are given in decimal format, but these represent % values (ie. 0.4878 is the same as 48.78%).</li>
        <li><b>Economic Connectedness</b> tells you the percentage of students who are friends with students from high-income backgrounds. For example, Harvard's Economic Connectedness is listed as, 0.843675, which means 84% of students from low-income backgrounds at Harvard have friends with high-incomes!
        <li><b>Median Debt</b> and <b>Median Salary</b> are listed in US Dollars. </li>
        <li> Any blank areas you see just means that this school does not provide this bit of information.
        </li>
