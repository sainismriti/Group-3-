    <h2>College Sorter</h2>

    <p>
      Below you'll see a table with information about every 4-year undergraduate
      college in the United States. Use the <b>"Column Visibility"</b> button to
      select whichever metric you're interested in comparing across schools. You
      can then filter each of the columns by either searching or using the how
      you'd like or you can simply use the search function to find a specific
      school.

    <p>
      Please note:
      <li>
        <b>Economic Connectedness</b> tells you the percentage of students who
        are friends with students from high-income backgrounds. For example,
        Harvard's Economic Connectedness is listed 84%, which means 84% of
        students from low-income backgrounds at Harvard have friends with
        high-incomes!
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Median Salary</b> is based on graduates salaries 6 years after
        entering the school (generally meaning 2 years after graduation).
      </li>
      <li>
        Any blank areas you see just means that this school does not provide
        this bit of information.
