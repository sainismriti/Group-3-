      <li>
        <b>Economic Connectedness</b> tells you the percentage of students who
        are friends with students from high-income backgrounds. For example,
        Harvard's Economic Connectedness is listed 84%, which means 84% of
        students from low-income backgrounds at Harvard have friends with
        high-incomes!
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Median Salary</b> is based on graduates salaries 6 years after
        entering the school (generally meaning 2 years after graduation).
      </li>
      <li>
        Any <b>blank</b> areas you see just means that this school does not provide
        this bit of information.
