        >Studies show</a>
      that the top five reasons students choose a school are:
      <li>Affordability</li>
      <li>Degree programs offered</li>
      <li>Reputation / academic quality</li>
      <li>Career outcomes / job opportunities for graduates</li>
      <li>Value of the education for the cost</li>
    </p>

        href="https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/social-capital-ii-determinants-of-economic-connectedness"
        >Other studies</a
      >
      also show that the greater connection there is between students of
      high-income and low-income backgrounds, the greater chance low income
      students have of upward mobility. This is sometimes referred to as "social
      capital" and there is yet another important measurement called "economic
      connectedness" that shows which schools are best at this.
    </p>

    <p>While all of this information is available <i>somewhere</i>, how can students be expected to keep track of all of it?

    <h3>That's where we come in!</h3>
    <p>
      To help students evaluate schools based on all of these considerations, our website will help you compare the most important metrics between schools all in one place, so that you can narrow your list of schools to the ones that are most likely to help you meet your career
      goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our <b>College Sorter</b> will help you compare schools based on:
      <li>
        <span class="highlight"
          ><u><b>Admissions Rates</b></u></span
        >
        for each school
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight"
          ><u><b>ACT and SAT Scores</b></u></span
        >
        to show where you're competitive
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight"
          ><u><b>Size of the School</b></u></span

      <li>
        <span class="highlight"
          ><u><b>Graduation Rates</b></u></span
        >
        to show how likely students are to leave with a degree
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight"
          ><u><b>Debt</b></u></span

      <li>
        <span class="highlight"
          ><u><b>Economic Connectedness</b></u></span
