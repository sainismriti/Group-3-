      Choosing which schools to apply to isn't easy. With hundreds of schools to
      choose from and hundreds of websites with different metrics to evaluate
      schools by, we wanted to streamline the college application selection
      process.
    </p>
    <h3>What do students care about?</h3>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://www.collegematchpoint.com/college-matchpoint-blog/2018/4/making-the-right-choice-how-students-decide-which-college-to-attend"
        >Studies show</a
      >
      that the top five reasons students choose a college are:
      <li>Affordability</li>
      <li>Degree programs offered</li>
      <li>Reputation / academic quality</li>
      <li>Career outcomes / job opportunities for graduates</li>
      <li>Value of the education for the cost</li>
    </p>
    <h3>Is there anything else you should consider?</h3>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/social-capital-ii-determinants-of-economic-connectedness"
        >Other studies</a
      >
      also that the greater connectedness there is between students of
      high-income and low-income backgrounds, the greater chance low income
      students have of upward mobility. This is sometimes referred to as "social
      capital" and there is yet another important measurement called "economic
      connectedness" that shows which schools are best at this.
    </p>
    <h3>What we offer:</h3>
    <p>
      There are many different websites and resources that together have all of
      this important information, but we want to put all of this in one place to
      make things easier. To help students evaluate schools based on these
      concerns, our website will help you compare the most important metrics
      between schools all in one place, so that you can narrow your list of
      schools to the ones that are most likely to help you meet your career
      goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our <b>College Sorter</b> will help you compare schools based on:
      <li>
       <span class="highlight"><u><b>Admissions Rates</b></u></span> for each school
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight"><u><b>ACT and SAT Scores</b></u></span> to show where
        you're competitive
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight"><u><b>Size of the School</b></u></span> by  number of undergraduates
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight"><u><b>Graduation Rates</b></u></span> to show how likely students are to leave with a degree
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight"><u><b>Debt</b></u></span> for all graduates leaving the school
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight"><u><b>Salary</b></u></span> two years after graduation
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight"><u><b>Economic Connectedness</b></u></span> to tell you which
        schools offer the strongest social networks to improve your social capital
      </li>
