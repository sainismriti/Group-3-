    <h1>Our Demonstration Website</h1>
    <p>
      We know how stressful college applications can be. With so many schools to
      choose from and so many different considerations to take into mind, it may
      be hard to even get started with your search. Well don't fear -- that's
      what this site is for!

      XX% of high school students say that X and Y are the most important
      determinants of which schools they'd like to attend. We want to make it
      easy for high school students and their parents to compare schools based
      on the most critical factors: future earnings potential and social
      capital.
