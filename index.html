    <h1>Our Demonstration Website</h1>
    <p>
      We know how stressful college applications can be. With so many schools to
      choose from and so many different considerations to take into mind, it may
      be hard to even get started with your search. Well don't fear -- that's
      what this site is for!
    </p>

    <p>
      XX% of high school students say that X and Y are the most important
      determinants of which schools they'd like to attend. We want to make it
      easy for high school students and their parents to compare schools based
      on the most critical factors: future earnings potential and social
      capital.

    <h2>Best Available Resources</h2>
    <p>The good news is that there are already a couple great resources to help you understand which schools will statistically offer you the best opportunities. </p>

    <h3>College Scorecard </h3>
    <p> First, we recommend the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/compare">College Scorecard's Compare Page</a> from the U.S. Department of Education. Here you'll find a database that allows you to compare schools based on annual costs, graduation rates, typical earnings of graduates, average test scores, and acceptance rate. Just search for the schools you're considering, select as many as you'd like, and hit compare!  </p>

     <h3>Social Capital Atlas </h3>
    <p> Next, we recommend Opportunity Insights' <a href="https://socialcapital.org/?dimension=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&geoLevel=college&selectedId=&dim1=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&dim2=CohesivenessClustering&dim3=CivicEngagementVolunteeringRates&bigModalSection=&bigModalChart=scatterplot&showOutliers=false&colorBy=">Social Capital Atlas</a>. By selecting 'college' under the 'view' section at the top of the page, you will now see a measurement of "economic connectedness" for every school in the U.S. This number tells you for students from low-income backgrounds, what percentage of their friends at this school come from high-income backgrounds. This may sound like a strange way to evaluate schools, but it's actually quite valuable. Social scientists have found that "social capital" or the economic strength of your community, plays a great role in your own upward income mobility. The greater the economic connectedness score shown at the link above, the more likely this college is to help you build you a strong network.</p>
