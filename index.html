      Choosing which schools to apply to isn't easy. With hundreds of schools
      to choose from and hundreds of websites with different metrics to evaluate
      schools by, we wanted to streamline the college application selection
      process.
    </p>
    <h3>What do students care about?</h3>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://www.collegematchpoint.com/college-matchpoint-blog/2018/4/making-the-right-choice-how-students-decide-which-college-to-attend"
      >Studies show</a>
      that the top five reasons students choose a college are:
      <li>Affordability</li>
      <li>Degree programs offered</li>
      <li>Reputation / academic quality</li>
      <li>Career outcomes / job opportunities for graduates</li>
      <li>Value of the education for the cost</li>
    </p>
    <h3>What other info should you care about?</h3>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/social-capital-ii-determinants-of-economic-connectedness">Other studies</a>
      also that the greater connectedness there is between students of
      high-income and low-income backgrounds, the greater chance low income
      students have of upward mobility. This is sometimes referred to as "social
      capital" and there is yet another important measurement called "economic connectedness" that
      shows which schools are best at this.
    </p>
    <h3>What we offer:</h3>
    <p>
      There are many different websites and resources that together have all of
      this important information, but we want to put all of this in one place to
      make things easier. To help students evaluate schools based on these
      concerns, our website will help you compare the most important metrics between schools all in one place, so that you can narrow your list of schools to the ones that are most likely to help you meet your career goals.

      <p>Our College Sorter will help you compare schools based on:
         <li> <span class="highlight"><b>Expected Costs</b></span> based on your family income level</li>
      <li> <span class="highlight"><b>Average Debt</b></span> for students like you</li>
      <li> <span class="highlight"><b>Average Salary</b></span> of graduates</li>
      <li> <span class="highlight"><b>Social Capital</b></span> to tell you which schools offer the strongest social networks</li>
      <li> <span class="highlight"><b>Average Test Scores</b></span> to show where you're competitive </li>

       <p>
      
      <p> Let's get started by clicking below to navigate to our College Sorter!</p>

    <h2>Best Available Resources</h2>
    <p>
      The good news is that there are already a few great resources to help you
      understand which schools will statistically offer you the best
      opportunities.
    </p>

    <h3>College Scorecard</h3>
    <p>
      First, we recommend the
      <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/compare"
        >College Scorecard's Compare Page</a
      >
      from the U.S. Department of Education. Here you'll find a database that
      allows you to compare schools based on:
    </p>

    <p>
      <li>annual costs</li>
      <li>graduation rates</li>
      <li>typical earnings of graduates</li>
      <li>average test scores</li>
      <li>acceptance rate</li>
    </p>
    <p>
      Just search for the schools you're considering, select as many as you'd
      like, and hit compare!
    </p>

    <h3>Social Capital Atlas</h3>
    <p>
      Next, we recommend Opportunity Insights'
      <a
        href="https://socialcapital.org/?dimension=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&geoLevel=college&selectedId=&dim1=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&dim2=CohesivenessClustering&dim3=CivicEngagementVolunteeringRates&bigModalSection=&bigModalChart=scatterplot&showOutliers=false&colorBy="
        >Social Capital Atlas</a
      >. By selecting 'college' under the 'view' section at the top of the page,
      you will now see a measurement of "economic connectedness" for every
      school in the U.S. This number tells you for students from low-income
      backgrounds, what percentage of their friends at this school come from
      high-income backgrounds. This may sound like a strange way to evaluate
      schools, but it's actually quite valuable. Social scientists have found
      that "social capital" or the economic strength of your community, plays a
      great role in your own upward income mobility. The greater the economic
      connectedness score shown at the link above, the more likely this college
      is to help you build you a strong network.
    </p>

    <h3>College Salary Report</h3>
    <p>
      If you're only concerned about future salary, we recommend payscale's
      <a href="https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors"
        >College Salary Report</a
      >. This site provides you with an easy to use page that allows you to
      search specific schools and compare expected salary 5 years after
      graduation (labeled "Early Career") as well as salaries 10 years after
      graduation (labeled "Mid-Career"). This offers a quick snapshot of how
      much money graduates of your schools of interest make throughout their
      career!
