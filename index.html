      Choosing which schools to apply to isn't easy. With thousands of schools
      to choose from and hundreds of websites with different metrics to evaluate
      schools by, we wanted to streamline the college application selection
      process.
    </p>
    <p> 
      <a
        href="https://www.collegematchpoint.com/college-matchpoint-blog/2018/4/making-the-right-choice-how-students-decide-which-college-to-attend"
      >
        Studies show</a
      >
      that the top five reasons students choose a college are:
      <li>Affordability</li>
      <li>Degree programs offered</li>
      <li>Reputation / academic quality</li>
      <li>Career outcomes / job opportunities for graduates</li>
      <li>Value of the education for the cost</li>
    </p>

    <p>
       <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/social-capital-ii-determinants-of-economic-connectedness"/> Other studies</a> also that the greater connectedness there is between students of high-income and low-income backgrounds, the greater chance low income students have of upward mobility. This is sometimes referred to as "social capital" and there is a measurement called "economic connectedness" that shows which schools are best at this.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many different websites and resources that together have all of
      this important information, but we want to put all of this in one place to
      make things easier. To help students evaluate schools based on these
      concerns, our website will help you compare tuition costs, career
      outcomes, and social capital all in one place, to help you choose a school
      that is affordable and likely to help you meet your career goals. Let`s
      get started.

    <h2>Best Available Resources</h2>
    <p>
      The good news is that there are already a few great resources to help you
      understand which schools will statistically offer you the best
      opportunities.
    </p>

    <h3>College Scorecard</h3>
    <p>
      First, we recommend the
      <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/compare"
        >College Scorecard's Compare Page</a
      >
      from the U.S. Department of Education. Here you'll find a database that
      allows you to compare schools based on:
    </p>

    <p>
      <li>annual costs</li>
      <li>graduation rates</li>
      <li>typical earnings of graduates</li>
      <li>average test scores</li>
      <li>acceptance rate</li>
    </p>
    <p>
      Just search for the schools you're considering, select as many as you'd
      like, and hit compare!
    </p>

    <h3>Social Capital Atlas</h3>
    <p>
      Next, we recommend Opportunity Insights'
      <a
        href="https://socialcapital.org/?dimension=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&geoLevel=college&selectedId=&dim1=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&dim2=CohesivenessClustering&dim3=CivicEngagementVolunteeringRates&bigModalSection=&bigModalChart=scatterplot&showOutliers=false&colorBy="
        >Social Capital Atlas</a
      >. By selecting 'college' under the 'view' section at the top of the page,
      you will now see a measurement of "economic connectedness" for every
      school in the U.S. This number tells you for students from low-income
      backgrounds, what percentage of their friends at this school come from
      high-income backgrounds. This may sound like a strange way to evaluate
      schools, but it's actually quite valuable. Social scientists have found
      that "social capital" or the economic strength of your community, plays a
      great role in your own upward income mobility. The greater the economic
      connectedness score shown at the link above, the more likely this college
      is to help you build you a strong network.
    </p>

    <h3>College Salary Report</h3>
    <p>
      If you're only concerned about future salary, we recommend payscale's
      <a href="https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors"
        >College Salary Report</a
      >. This site provides you with an easy to use page that allows you to
      search specific schools and compare expected salary 5 years after
      graduation (labeled "Early Career") as well as salaries 10 years after
      graduation (labeled "Mid-Career"). This offers a quick snapshot of how
      much money graduates of your schools of interest make throughout their
      career!
