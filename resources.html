    <h1>Additional Resources</h1>
    <p>

      used a variety of resources and below you will find a list of each with

    <h3>College Scorecard</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <img
        class="logo1"
        src="../images/college_scorecard.png"
        alt="Dept of Education"
      />
      <div>
        <p>
          First, we used
          <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/compare"
            >College Scorecard's Compare Page</a
          >
          from the U.S. Department of Education. Here you'll find a database
          that allows you to compare schools based on:
        </p>

        <p>
          <li>annual costs</li>
          <li>graduation rates</li>
          <li>typical earnings of graduates</li>
          <li>average test scores</li>
          <li>acceptance rates</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          Just search for the schools you're considering, select as many as
          you'd like, and hit compare!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Social Capital Atlas</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <img
        class="logo2"
        src="../images/opportunity_insights.png"
        alt="Dept of Education"
      />
      <div>
        <p>
          Next, for all things Social Capital, we used Opportunity Insights'
          <a
            href="https://socialcapital.org/?dimension=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&geoLevel=college&selectedId=&dim1=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&dim2=CohesivenessClustering&dim3=CivicEngagementVolunteeringRates&bigModalSection=&bigModalChart=scatterplot&showOutliers=false&colorBy="
            >Social Capital Atlas</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          By selecting 'college' under the 'view' section at the top of the
          page, you will see each school's <i>economic connectedness</i> score.
          The greater the <i>economic connectedness</i> score, the better this
          school is at connecting people across income classes and the more
          likely this college is to help you build you a strong network. If this
          interests you, there are also some additional statistics that break
          down other measures of Social Capital.

    <h3>College Salary Report</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <img
        class="logo3"
        src="../images/college_salary_report.png"
        alt="Dept of Education"
      />
      <div>
        <p>
          If you're only concerned about future salary, we recommend payscale's
          <a href="https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors"
            >College Salary Report</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site provides you with an easy to use page that allows you to
          search specific schools and compare expected salary 5 years after
          graduation (labeled "Early Career") as well as salaries 10 years after
          graduation (labeled "Mid-Career"). This offers a quick snapshot of how
          much money graduates of your schools of interest make throughout their
          career!
