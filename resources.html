    <h1>Additional Resources</h1>
    <p>
        We used a variety of resource links and below you will find a list of all those links used to develop this website. 
    </p>


    <h2>Best Available Resources</h2>
    <p>
      The good news is that there are already a few great resources to help you
      understand which schools will statistically offer you the best
      opportunities.
    </p>

    <h3>College Scorecard</h3>
    <p>
      First, we recommend the
      <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/compare"
        >College Scorecard's Compare Page</a
      >
      from the U.S. Department of Education. Here you'll find a database that
      allows you to compare schools based on:
    </p>

    <p>
      <li>annual costs</li>
      <li>graduation rates</li>
      <li>typical earnings of graduates</li>
      <li>average test scores</li>
      <li>acceptance rate</li>
    </p>
    <p>
      Just search for the schools you're considering, select as many as you'd
      like, and hit compare!
    </p>

    <h3>Social Capital Atlas</h3>
    <p>
      Next, we recommend Opportunity Insights'
      <a
        href="https://socialcapital.org/?dimension=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&geoLevel=college&selectedId=&dim1=EconomicConnectednessIndividual&dim2=CohesivenessClustering&dim3=CivicEngagementVolunteeringRates&bigModalSection=&bigModalChart=scatterplot&showOutliers=false&colorBy="
        >Social Capital Atlas</a
      >. By selecting 'college' under the 'view' section at the top of the page,
      you will now see a measurement of "economic connectedness" for every
      school in the U.S. This number tells you for students from low-income
      backgrounds, what percentage of their friends at this school come from
      high-income backgrounds. This may sound like a strange way to evaluate
      schools, but it's actually quite valuable. Social scientists have found
      that "social capital" or the economic strength of your community, plays a
      great role in your own upward income mobility. The greater the economic
      connectedness score shown at the link above, the more likely this college
      is to help you build you a strong network.
    </p>

    <h3>College Salary Report</h3>
    <p>
      If you're only concerned about future salary, we recommend payscale's
      <a href="https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors"
        >College Salary Report</a
      >. This site provides you with an easy to use page that allows you to
      search specific schools and compare expected salary 5 years after
      graduation (labeled "Early Career") as well as salaries 10 years after
      graduation (labeled "Mid-Career"). This offers a quick snapshot of how
      much money graduates of your schools of interest make throughout their
      career!
